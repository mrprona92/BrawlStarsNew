In addition to being able to do very well with Shelly in the first ever game with her, she’s a beast in 1 on 1 situations, and can even overpower entire teams if they’re foolish enough to group up for her. Shelly is an extremely versatile brawler that can make a significant impact in the majority of the game modes. She’ll make a great addition to nearly any team.","mDefaultAbility":{"attackDeplay":"0.1 s","damage":"80","description":"Shelly\u0027s boomstick is always locked and loaded.
