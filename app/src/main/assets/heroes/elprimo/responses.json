He’s a very easy character to get the hang of. Simply slap and punch targets that are next to you. Simply enough right? Of course there are nuances to learn, but for the most part, he is a character that you can be competitive with right away in every game mode. His versatility between game modes make him a top choice for players who’d like to consider El Primo their ‘main’ brawler.","mDefaultAbility":{"attackDeplay":"0.15 s","damage":"80","description":"El Primo fires off a furious flurry of four fiery fists.That\u0027s a spicy jalapeno knuckle sandwich!","name":"Fists of Fury","range":"2.5 tiles","timeCharger":"0.8 s","typeAbility":"Attack"},"mSuperAbility":{"attackDeplay":"None","damage":"200","description":"Leaping high, El Primo drops an Intergalactic Elbow that pounds and pushes away anything he lands on!","name":"Flying Elbow Drop","range":"8 tiles","typeAbility":"Charge"},"modeRanking":["4","6","4","5"],"priority":["1. health","2. attack","3. super"],"progress8Info":["100%","30%","90%","100%","60%","100%","60%","30%"],"role5Info":{"hitpoints":"1300","role":"Melee Bruiser","speed":"2.5 tiles per second","tier":"Common","type":"Melee"},"strengths":["Extremely strong brawler with some the highest sustained damage output in the game.","His range is deceptively long - much farther than you’d anticipate a melee character to be.","In addition to hitting really, really hard… he also has a giant amount of hitpoints.","His Flying Elbow Drop can work very well both offensively and defensively. Defensively it can be used as an Escape. Offensively you can use it to separate a straggling player from their team.","His super also destroys walls/cover and provides a knockback effect to other brawlers. This makes him a great choice for opening up Line of sight to the safe on Heist, or for destroy cover that enemies can hide behind in in Bounty or Smash \u0026 Grab.","Primo is never out of the fight with his ability to close the gap with his super, and if he does make it into Melee range, you can expect to lose several hundred hit points with each thundering slap sequence.","His extreme damage and hitpoints make him the #1 choice for the Showdown game mode, and because of this, he is likely the brawler with the most overall wins on Showdown."],"tips":["Very kitable if his super is not up.","Prone to missing slaps if the target is in extreme proximity (basically at point blank range).","Killing spawnables allows enemies to build super energy up."],"weaknesses":["Very kitable if his super is not up.","Prone to missing slaps if the target is in extreme proximity (basically at point blank range).","Killing spawnables allows enemies to build super energy up."]}]
