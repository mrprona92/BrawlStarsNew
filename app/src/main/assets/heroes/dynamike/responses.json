This can be very useful as a support player, especially in objective based game modes like Heist \u0026 Smash \u0026 Grab. He can deal loads of damage to grouped up opponents, and he can control an area very well provided that he has distractions (like his teammates) in the area, but the second Dynamike is alone… it gets very lonely for him. Like a bleeding fish in shark infested waters, he will quickly be pressured and overcome by force. Dynamike has very similar abilities to Barley, who in most cases is the superior area splash character.

Key distinction... AREA.","Because Dynamike is so strong at dealing damage to an area, he can easily lock down and control areas of the map.","Dynamike is a very strong character when posturing defensively.","#1 advantage that Dynamike has over most other Brawlers is that he doesn’t need line of sight to deal damage to his enemies. He simply needs to be in range.","Dynamike’s super is very strong and deals a lot of direct damage to a significant radius around its detonation spot.","Big Barrel o’ Boom can also destroy walls \u0026 cover… this is a distinction that not many of the brawlers have, so being able to open up new passageways, or offer your team mates line of sight to hiding opponents is very valuable.","Dynamike is a master at making key staging areas in objective based play inaccessible due to damage."],"tips":["Dynamike does not deal damage to targets, so it is quite difficult to land damage sometimes as your opponent can fake you out to move in another direction.","Dynamike’s primary attack is usually dodgeable because it is quite slow.","Dynamike has low HP and is also very weak to melee characters because he has to move to run away but also must drop dynamite to try and stop the aggressor. It almost rarely happens. There is a buffer area with Dynamike that he makes difficult to cross because of his ability to move and drop bombs right in your path, BUT once across, he’s almost certainly dead meat."],"weaknesses":["Dynamike does not deal damage to targets, so it is quite difficult to land damage sometimes as your opponent can fake you out to move in another direction.","Dynamike’s primary attack is usually dodgeable because it is quite slow.","Dynamike has low HP and is also very weak to melee characters because he has to move to run away but also must drop dynamite to try and stop the aggressor.
